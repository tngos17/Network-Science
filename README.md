Data Science on Network Traffic Data!

Understanding network traffic is one of the most pressing issues to the information security professional. In this exercise I will be using the HIKARI 2021 data set to demonstraite some basic machine learning models as well as go over the techniques ued to get there. I had a lot of fun doing this and hope you will enjoy it as well!

# Project Flow Chart
![Project Outline_](https://github.com/tngos17/Network-Science/assets/64931318/f4348a9c-994c-493e-8d2d-81bbbf08275d)

# Importing the Data
Download the HIKARI 2021 Dataset from here: https://zenodo.org/records/6463389

You will want the ALLFLOWMETER_HIKARI2021.csv and not the .pcap files although we will be taking a look at them later.

Next you will want to import the data into your python environment of choice. For this exercise primarily used Jupyter Notebooks however some alternatives like Kaggle can actually handle the entire `.csv'. As we get to more advances sections of the project we will dive into SQL implementation however, the process above should be fine for now.
