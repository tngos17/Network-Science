Download the HIKARI 2021 Dataset from here: https://zenodo.org/records/6463389

You will want the `ALLFLOWMETER_HIKARI2021.csv` and not the `.pcap` files although we will be taking a look at them later.

Next you will want to import the data into your python environment of choice. For this exercise primarily used Jupyter Notebooks however some alternatives like Kaggle can actually handle the entire `.csv'.
As we get to more advances sections of the project we will dive into SQL implementation however, the process above should be fine for now.
